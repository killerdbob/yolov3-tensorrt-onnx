How to use!
First, you should provide a pretrained onnx or trt file, put it in the current directory.
Second, you should create an instance of yolov3, and just run the function of "readVideo(SyncQueue<output> *queuebuffer, string filename)", 
queuebuffer is an 'SyncQueue' instance in 'queue.cpp', 'filename' could be a mp4 or rtsp stream.
